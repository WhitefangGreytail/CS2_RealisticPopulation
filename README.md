# Cities Skylines 2 : Realistic Population

Changes the calculation for non low density residential households
Allocation of housing is now front loaded, so that level 1 has the most households with the increases being small there after.
Industrial and commercial buildings have small capacity boosts
Offices have large multipliers to the building, ranging from 50 workers for a 2x2 buildings to 2250 for 6x6 plots

The values for high density are based off building density values stated in this video about Hong Kong density

## Instructions
No setting available, although that is something that can be added in the future.

### Safe to activate for existing cities
Existing building capacities are not affected. Only buildings that start their construction while the mod is active has their capacity changed.

### Safe to remove at any time
This mod is not required to load any saves made with it.  Saves made with this mod will work perfectly fine without it (workplace calculations have already been stored in the building data on creation). Future buildings will revert to the original calculation.

## Requirements

## Installation
1. Make sure that BepInEx 5 is installed.

## Misc

### Source code
[Available on GitHub](https://github.com/WhitefangGreytail/WG_CS2_RealisticPopulation) (
WhitefangGreytail/WG_CS2_RealisticPopulation).

Be wary of mods without publicly available source code, it's too easy to download executables from somewhere and find it has been changed. Even then, "Trust, but verify", would be the motto I would say here.

### Why even think about trusting me then?
Author of Realistic Population in Cities Skylines before handing it over to algernon-A. The repos in my GitHub still have them available for viewing.
I wanted to make this mod, primarily for myself. Did learn a few things about the corner I was interested in, comments in the code.
